<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D student at School of Artificial Intelligence, OPtics and ElectroNics (iOPEN), <a href="https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/">Northwestern Polytechnical University</a>. My supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2oB4nAIAAAAJ">Feiping Nie</a> in IDEAL Lab. I have published several papers in top-tier international AI conferences and journals, including TKDE, IJCAI, PR, NN and ESWA.

My research interests focus on the following areas:

- Complex multi-view/modal clustering/learning
- Time series representation learning
